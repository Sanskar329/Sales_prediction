Premium demand forecasting is a key aspect of procurement management. Forecasts are crucial in determining stock levels, and the precise estimation of future demand for goods , particularly in supermarket and grocery stores sector. If the products are not readily available or the supply is higher than sales demand , companies has to suffer a lot of loss ,accurate sales estimates for products is important to ensure that these losses are minimised.

There are various factors that effects sales of a product which cannot be analysed manually.In this analysis , A predictive model is developed using appropriate machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of product sales forecasts. 

The proposed model aims to help potential purchases by predicting product sales. In the notebook we have analysed and compared multiple regression methods.A Model is prepared to forecast inventory demand accurately, based on historical sales data.

For beginners, this is a perfect project to learn data analytics and apply machine learning algorithms to forecast outlet sales efficiently.

Objectives:

1.)Analyse dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. 

2.)Preprocess Data 

3.)Fit regression models and compute RMSE and R-Square.

4.)Loop through various regularization parameters 

5.)Fit residual plots .

6.)Give analysis on which independent variables have significant impact on the Sales of an outlet , call it as a best model.

7.)Using this best model, predict the values of sales for the given test data and compute RMSE and R-Square.
