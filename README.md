# Sales_prediction

Premium demand forecasting is a key aspect of procurement management. Forecasts are crucial for precise estimation of product's demand , particularly in supermarket and grocery stores sector. If the products are not readily available or the supply is higher than sales demand , companies has to suffer huge losses .To minimize such losses , accurate sales prediction is very important.

In this analysis , a predictive model is developed using appropriate machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of product sales forecast. 

In the notebook we have analysed and compared multiple regression methods.

Finally , a Model is prepared to forecast inventory demand accurately, based on historical sales data.

For beginners, this is a perfect project to learn data analytics and apply machine learning algorithms to forecast outlet sales efficiently.

**Objectives:**

1.)Analyse dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. 

2.)Preprocess Data appropriately.

3.)Fit regression models and compute RMSE and R-Square.

4.)Loop through various regularization parameters 

5.)Fit residual plots .

6.)Give analysis on which independent variables have significant impact on the Sales of an outlet , call it as a best model.

7.)Using this best model, predict the values of sales for the given test data and compute RMSE and R-Square.

**Conclusion**
The Best model is developed using Ridge Resgression model which involves log transformation as key data manipulation which facilitates for better performance.
The final Residual plot for Ridge regression model is
