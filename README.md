# Sales_prediction

Objectives:

1.)Analyse dataset and perform exploratory analysis. 

2.)Treat the missing values appropriately

3.)Deal with categorical data.

4.)Normalize the data.

5.)Fit regression models and compute RMSE and R-Square.

6.)Apply regularization techniques on the data. 

7.)Loop through various regularization parameters to display and compare R-Square.

8.)Fit residual plots .

9.)Give analysis on which independent variables have significant impact on the Sales of an outlet , call it as a best model.

10.)Using this best model, predict the values of sales for the given test data and compute RMSE and R-Square.
